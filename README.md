# ORKG4LaTeX
ORKG4LaTeX makes it possible to annotate research contributions in the style of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) directly in the LaTeX source. Authors of scientific publications can enrich their documents with distilled semantic informations on the content of their research. The information is then embedded into the PDF's metadata where they can be retrieved by anyone who obtains the PDF document and persists for the lifetime of the document.

Contributions in the ORKG can have different properties like *research problem*, *methods* or *result*.
