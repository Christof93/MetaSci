# ORKG4LaTeX
ORKG4LaTeX makes it possible to annotate specific **research contributions** directly in the LaTeX source code. The idea of extracting research contributions from scholarly publications is derived from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).

With ORKG4Latex, authors of scientific publications can enrich their documents with machine-readable, structured information which in turn helps to improve visibility in search engines and recommendation engines.
The ORKG information triples are embedded into the PDF's XMP metadata where they can be retrieved by anyone who obtains the PDF document and persist for the lifetime of the document.
Additionally the contributions can easily be added to the knowledge graph by just uploading the annotated document to the ORKG web portal.

Let's look at an example:
